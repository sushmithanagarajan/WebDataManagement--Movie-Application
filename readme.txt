Language: python
Version : 2.7

Code-Working on Omega : yes
Not ready for tournament : No
Havent really prepared my code with great standards, i agree to not participate


Code Explanation:
My code consists of two programs, which has a underlying template from professor for maxconnect4 game

I have split every small functionality into multiple methods, it may involve litte more complexity than usual but serves the purpose for which it has to work
I have implemented minmax, alpha beta pruning, depth limited search to predict best possible move

Explanation :
Code works on logic instructed by professor in class in a step by step fashion
Eval function : idea partially derived from this page https://github.com/erikackermann/Connect-Four he had a nice structure of evaluvation utility values.
If utility value is more then the computer can best predict decision.
Also attached a time sheet excel for every depth line


Input Type:
Interactive Mode Syntax : 

$python maxconnect4.py interactive input.txt computer-next/human-next depth
The game keeps playing until 42 moves

One-move Mode Syntax : 

$python maxconnect4.py one-move input_file output_file depth
